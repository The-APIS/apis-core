# The APIS Core

Visit [TheApis Website](https://www.theapis.io/) and check out [TheApis White Paper](https://static.theapis.io/whitepaper.pdf).

APIS is a middleware protocol for the functioning of a decentralized
index and querying protocol, allowing for the mainstream growth of a fully decentralized
fnance and decentralized web architecture. Current data index and querying solutions are
either centrally architected, reliant on a party who at all times is subject to numerous
performance and regulatory risks, or logically decentralized, thus requiring an in-depth
knowledge of the public blockchain protocol layer and obscuring the majority of global
developers from interacting with public blockchain infrastructure. APIS is architecturally
decentralized, in that the providers of the endpointed data can be any actor joins the APIS
network, but logically centralized, in that client-side developers will be able to reference
common, frequented API formatting structures, namely RESTful and GraphQL endpoints, to
query datasets generated by public blockchains.

# Development


## Setup

Clone the apis-core repository

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/The-APIS/apis-core.git
```

Create the .env file at project root and run the build scripts. See `.env-example` for the list of environment variables and defaults.

```bash
cd apis-core/
cp .env-example .env
```

## Run


TL;DR: Using task runner:


```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```


By service or chain:


```bash
# ex: run just the gateway
docker-compose up gateway

# ex: run all ethereum services
docker-compose up ethereum*

# ex: run all bitcoin services
docker-compose up bitcoin*

# ex: run everything
docker-compose up

```



# Production


## Run


```bash
npm run build-production
npm run start-production
```


# Notes

> See individual service README files
> (`gateway` is a good place to start)
